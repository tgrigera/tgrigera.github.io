In my current research I apply the methods of statistical physics to study biological systems.  I strive to combine analysis of experiments, numerical simulation and modelling and theoretical arguments to develop understanding of the collective properties of biological systems, as, for example the development of order.

The main current lines are:

 - __Animal movement__
 : Study of the collective properties of animals in motion (bird flocks and insect swarms) through minimal modelling, numerical simulations and field theory.

 - __Growth and motion of groups of cells and tissues__

 - __Dynamics of neuronal networks__

<!--  - __Disordered systems__ -->
