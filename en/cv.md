I graduated in physics at La Plata and obtained my PhD here in 1998.
Before joining IFLYSIB in late 2014, I worked at
[INIFTA](http://www.inifta.unlp.edu.ar) as a CONICET researcher from
late 2003, and before that I was a postdoc in the Department of
Physics of Northeastern University, Boston (1998--1999) and in the
Department of Physics of the University of Rome _La Sapienza_
(2000--2003).
