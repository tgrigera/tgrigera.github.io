As part of my duties as professor at the [Department of Physics](http://www.fisica.unlp.edu.ar) of the University of La Plata, I typically teach two undergraduate courses per academic year (sometimes one undergraduate and one graduate course, sometimes two undergraduate and one graduate).

## Undergraduate courses

At the department we teach students of physics as well as students from other departments that have basic physics courses in their curricula.  Personally, I teach of have taught (for more details see the Spanish page):

 - Thermodynamics (2009--2011, 2025--2026) for students of physics and astronomy.
 
 - Statistical Mechanics (second course) (2020--2023).  For students of the last year (5th) of physics), focusing on phase transitions and an introduction to field theory of statistical mechanics.

 - Computer simulations (2018--2020), mostly for students of physics with some basic knowledge of statistical mechanics.
 
 - A first course of Physics (Physics for freshmen or Physics 101), mainly an introduction to mechanics (2015--2017).

 - Computing (2013--2016), an introduction to computers and programming for 2nd year students of Physics and Medical Physics.
 
 - Partial differential equation for students of physics (2012--2014).

 - A first physics course for students of chemistry and biochemistry (2005--2011).


## Graduate courses

 - Statistical field theory (2021, 2023, 2025)

 - Order and disorder in complex systems: applications to condensed matter and biological systems (with R. A. Borzi, S. A. Grigera and O. Chara)

 - Disordered systems (2009, 2012, 2014)
 
 I also collaborate teaching one or two lessons in the graduate course (organized by C. M. Carlevaro and R. Irastorza):
 
 - Computational tools for scientists (since 2008).
