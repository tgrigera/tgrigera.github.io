I am a researcher working at the Statistical Biophysics (BiEs) group
at [IFLySiB](http://www.iflysib.unlp.edu.ar), a research institute
jointly dependent from [CONICET](http://www.conicet.gov.ar)
(Argentina's national research council) and the [University of La
Plata](http://www.unlp.edu.ar), and staffed mainly by physicists.  I
also teach various courses at the [Department of
physics](http://www.fisica.unlp.edu.ar) of the same University (about
2km from IFLYSIB).

I graduated in physics at La Plata and obtained my PhD here in 1998.
Before joining IFLYSIB in late 2014, I worked at
[INIFTA](http://www.inifta.unlp.edu.ar) as a CONICET researcher from
late 2003, and before that I was a postdoc in the Department of
Physics of Northeastern University, Boston (1998--1999) and in the
Department of Physics of the University of Rome _La Sapienza_
(2000--2003).
