 abstract      = {Random sequential deposition of diffusing dimers onto a two-dimensional lattice is investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the jamming occupation for the static case is surpassed; however, the completely filled state is not reached due to the appearence of ``dynamically jammed structures''. The conjectured time dependence law \$(1/t)\textbackslash ln t\$ fails to fit the simulations.}
