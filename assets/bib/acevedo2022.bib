 abstract      = {We study the so-called neural network flow of spin configurations in the 2-{$d$} Ising ferromagnet. This flow is generated by successive reconstructions of spin configurations, obtained by an artificial neural network like a restricted Boltzmann machine or an autoencoder. It was reported recently that this flow may have a fixed point at the critical temperature of the system, and even allow the computation of critical exponents. Here we focus on the flow produced by a fully-connected autoencoder, and we refute the claim that this flow converges to the critical point of the system by directly measuring physical observables, and showing that the flow strongly depends on the network hyperparameters. We explore the network metric, the reconstruction error, and we relate it to the so called intrinsic dimension of data, to shed light on the origin and properties of the flow.}
