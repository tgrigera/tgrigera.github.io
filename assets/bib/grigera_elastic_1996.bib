 abstract      = {The elastic scattering structure factor of a single diblock copolymer chain is calculated up to first order in {$\epsilon$}(\$=4-d\$, with \$d\$ the dimensionality of the space) with the conformational space renormalization group method. The influence of several thermodynamic conditions on the scattering intensity is analyzed. Our results are compared with small-angle neutron scattering experiments under variable contrast conditions and numerical simulations of the zero average contrast case.}
