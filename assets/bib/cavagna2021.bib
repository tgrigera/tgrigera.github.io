    abstract = "We study the crossover between equilibrium and off-equilibrium dynamical universality classes in the Vicsek model near its ordering transition. Starting from the incompressible hydrodynamic theory of Chen et al. [Critical phenomenon of the order-disorder transition in incompressible active fluids, New J. Phys. 17, 042002 (2015)], we show that increasing the activity leads to a renormalization group (RG) crossover between the equilibrium ferromagnetic fixed point, with dynamical critical exponent z=2, and the off-equilibrium active fixed point, with z=1.7 (in d=3). We run simulations of the classic Vicsek model in the near-ordering regime and find that critical slowing down indeed changes with activity, displaying two exponents that are in remarkable agreement with the RG prediction. The equilibrium to off-equilibrium crossover is ruled by a characteristic length scale, beyond which active dynamics takes over. The larger the activity is, the smaller is such a length scale, suggesting the existence of a general trade-off between activity and the system's size in determining the dynamical universality class of active matter.",
