    abstract = "Motivated by the collective behavior of biological swarms, we study the critical dynamics of field theories with coupling between order parameter and conjugate momentum in the presence of dissipation. Under a fixed-network approximation, we perform a dynamical renormalization group calculation at one loop in the near-critical disordered region, and we show that the violation of momentum conservation generates a crossover between an unstable fixed point, characterized by a dynamic critical exponent z=d/2, and a stable fixed point with z=2. Interestingly, the two fixed points have different upper critical dimensions. The interplay between these two fixed points gives rise to a crossover in the critical dynamics of the system, characterized by a crossover exponent {$\kappa$}=4/d. The crossover is regulated by a conservation length scale R0, given by the ratio between the transport coefficient and the effective friction, which is larger as the dissipation is smaller: Beyond R0, the stable fixed point dominates, while at shorter distances dynamics is ruled by the unstable fixed point and critical exponent, a behavior which is all the more relevant in finite-size systems with weak dissipation. We run numerical simulations in three dimensions and find a crossover between the exponents z=3/2 and z=2 in the critical slowdown of the system, confirming the renormalization group results. From the biophysical point of view, our calculation indicates that in finite-size biological groups mode coupling terms in the equation of motion can significantly change the dynamical critical exponents even in the presence of dissipation, a step toward reconciling theory with experiments in natural swarms. Moreover, our result provides the scale within which fully conservative Bose-Einstein condensation is a good approximation in systems with weak symmetry-breaking terms violating number conservation, as quantum magnets or photon gases.",
